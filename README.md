# AWS Storage Gateway Terraform module

This repository contains Terraform code which creates resources required to run Storage Gateway (https://aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/) in AWS and on premises.

AWS Storage Gateway is available in 4 types :

- Amazon S3 File Gateway (FILE\_S3)
- Amazon FSx File Gateway (FILE\_FSX\_SMB)
- Tape Gateway (VTL)
- Volume Gateway (CACHED, STORED)

The module requires a Gateway type to be declared. The default is configured to FILE\_S3 as an example. For more details regarding the Storage Gateway types and their respective arguments can be found [here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/storagegateway_gateway).

## Usage with VMware S3 File Gateway module

- Link to the S3 SMB Storage Gateway example for VMware: [s3filegateway-vmware](examples/s3filegateway-vmware)

### Prerequisists

- The VMware module requires the vsphere provider to be setup with a service account user name and password that has the necessary permissions in Vcenter to create a VM. This is found in the [settings.tf](examples/s3filegateway-vmware/settings.tf) file.

```hcl

provider "vsphere" {
  allow_unverified_ssl = var.allow_unverified_ssl
  vsphere_server       = var.vsphere_server
  user                 = var.vsphere_user
  password             = var.vsphere_password
}

```

Note that var.allow\_unverified\_ssl is a boolean that can be set to true to disable SSL certificate verification. This should be used with care as it could allow an attacker to intercept your authentication token. The default value is set to false but can be changed to true for testing purposes only.

The module also requires connectivity to your vCenter server. Therefore it needs to be deployed from a virtual machine that can reach the vCenter APIs. You may also [Terraform Cloud Agents](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/agents) if you use already use Terrform Cloud. This allows the modules to be deployed remotely.

### [vSphere Module](modules/vmware-sgw/)

```hcl

module "vsphere" {
  source     = "aws-ia/storagegateway/aws//modules/vmware-sgw"
  datastore  = var.datastore
  datacenter = var.datacenter
  network    = var.network
  cluster    = var.cluster
  host       = var.host
  name       = "my-s3fgw"
}
```

The virtual machine IP address needs to be passed to next module as the gateway IP address. In addition, the module also requires domain user name and passwords for the storage gateway to join the domain.

Note that in order to protect sensitive data such as domain credentials etc., certain variables are marked as sensitive. It is general best practice to never store credentials and secrets in git repositories. For more information about protecting sensitive variables refer to [this](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/configuration-language/sensitive-variables#reference-sensitive-variables) documentation. Also as a best practice consider the use of services such as [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/), [Hashicorp Vault](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) or [Terraform Cloud](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/managing-credentials-in-terraform-cloud-and-enterprise) to dynamically inject your secrets.

Also note that the domain password despite being a sensitive variable can be still found in the Terraform state file. Follow [this guidance](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state/sensitive-data) to protect state file from unauthorized access.

### [Storage Gateway Module](modules/aws-sgw/)

```hcl
module "sgw" {
  source             = "aws-ia/storagegateway/aws//modules/aws-sgw"
  name               = "my-sgw"
  gateway_ip_address = module.vsphere.vm_ip
  join_smb_domain    = true
  domain_name        = var.domain_name
  domain_username    = var.domain_username
  domain_password    = var.domain_password
  domain_controllers = var.domain_controllers
  gateway_type       = "FILE_S3"       
}

```

Note that variable "join\_smb\_domain" is set to true by default and therefore optional. To create a Storage Gateway that is not joined to the domain set "join\_smb\_domain" to false.

Example :

```hcl
module "sgw" {
  source             = "aws-ia/storagegateway/aws//modules/aws-sgw"
  name               = "my-sgw"
  gateway_ip_address = module.vsphere.vm_ip
  join_smb_domain    = false
  gateway_type       = "FILE_S3"       
}

```

Refer to to the S3 NFS Storage Gateway example for VMware for an end to end example: [s3-nfs-filegateway-vmware](examples/s3-nfs-filegateway-vmware)

## Setting up S3 buckets for S3 File Gateway

```hcl
module "s3_bucket" {
  source                   = "terraform-aws-modules/s3-bucket/aws"
  version                  = ">=3.5.0"
  bucket                   = "bucket-name"
  control_object_ownership = true
  object_ownership         = "BucketOwnerEnforced"
  block_public_acls        = true
  block_public_policy      = true
  ignore_public_acls       = true
  restrict_public_buckets  = true

  server_side_encryption_configuration = {
    rule = {
      apply_server_side_encryption_by_default = {
        kms_master_key_id = "kms_key_id"
        sse_algorithm     = "aws:kms"
      }
    }
  }
  logging = {
    target_bucket = "log-delivery-bucket"
    target_prefix = "log/"
  }

  versioning = {
    enabled = false
  }
}
```
Note that versioning is set to false by default for the S3 bucket for the file share for Storage Gateway. Enabling S3 Versioning can increase storage costs within Amazon S3. Please see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/filegateway/latest/files3/CreatingAnSMBFileShare.html) for further information on whether S3 Versioning is right for your workload.

## Setting up SMB File shares

```hcl
module "smb_share" {
  source        = "aws-ia/storagegateway/aws//modules/s3-smb-share"
  share_name    = "smb_share_name"
  gateway_arn   = module.sgw.storage_gateway.arn
  bucket_arn    = module.s3_bucket.s3_bucket_arn
  role_arn      = "iam-role-for-sgw-s3"
  log_group_arn = "log-group-arn"
}
```

## Setting up NFS File shares

```hcl
module "nfs_share" {
  source        = "aws-ia/storagegateway/aws//modules/s3-nfs-share"
  share_name    = "nfs_share_name"
  gateway_arn   = module.sgw.storage_gateway.arn
  bucket_arn    = module.s3_bucket.s3_bucket_arn
  role_arn      = "iam-role-for-sgw-s3"
  log_group_arn = "log-group-arn"
  client_list   = ["10.0.0.0/24","10.0.1.0/24"]
}
```

The examples also includes "aws\_kms\_key" resource block to create a KMS key. For production deployments, you should pass in a key policy that restricts the use of the key based on your access requirements. Refer to this [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html) for information.
